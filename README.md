## Obstacle Detection Using Arduino And Ultrasonic Sensor

### Components Used:
  
Arduino UNO ,Ultrasonic Sensors,LEDâ€™s (Green and Red),Resistors (330ohm),Jumper Wires,Breadboard,USB Cable,LCD Display

 ### Obstacle Detection:

In this project an obstacle detection system will be built with Arduino. This system mainly uses an ultrasound sensor and LED.When the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle at a distance < 3cm, Arduino orders to show red light Otherwise green led will light.
